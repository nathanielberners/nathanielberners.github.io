            This website is alive, and I will be beginning to use it. Currently, I'm still working on styling,
            so look and feel may continue to change. But the fundamentals are all working and ready.

        <h3>SQLite3-Template - A Python SQLite3 interface stub; GitHub</h3>
        <h4>2024-06-21</h4>
        <p>
            Here I wanted to create a basic template in Python to connect to a SQLite3 database so that I can
            reuse the same template for any SQLite3 backed Python program I wanted to develop. It implements
            error handling and support username based permissions access. Once it completes all prechecks, it
            leaves you with a cursor connection ready to use.
