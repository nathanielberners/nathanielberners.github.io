            This website is alive, and I will be beginning to use it. Currently, I'm still working on styling,
            so look and feel may continue to change. But the fundamentals are all working and ready.

        <p>
            Here I wanted to create a basic template in Python to connect to a SQLite3 database so that I can
            reuse the same template for any SQLite3 backed Python program I wanted to develop. It implements
            error handling and support username based permissions access. Once it completes all prechecks, it
            leaves you with a cursor connection ready to use.

        <h3>StressIO - A Linux Bash script for testing hard drive reliability; GitHub</h3>
        <h4>2024-06-21</h4>
        <p>
            Back in my computer repair days, I would often (very often) have to deal with failed, failing or
            questionably operating hard disk drives. These drives all have internal error reporting called
            S.M.A.R.T. However, it is not fool proof verification method. Once, I had not flagged errors on
            one drive, but I was suspicious of one of the field values. So I ran a sequence of commands to
            fill the drive with random data, create fingerprints of the data and verify the integrity of all
            the files created. Sure enough, I had an integrity failure on one file on this drive which showed
            that either the electronics or mechanical subsystem couldn't be 100% reliable under heavier I/O
            operations. I subsequently used those commands to identifiy a couple of other unreliable drives.
            So here I have developed it in to a full script. Plug in your drive, run this script and it will
            handle the rest. But be warned: IT WILL DESTROY YOUR DATA; so make sure you have a backup first :)
